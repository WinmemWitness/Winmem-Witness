# FAQ

## What is Winmem?

Winmem is a deployable AI runtime for Solana projects after active development stops. It preserves visibility, memory, and auditability through structured witness logs and verifiable proofs.

## Is Winmem an operating system?

No. Winmem does not manage hardware resources or run arbitrary programs. It manages a project's existence state: observable records, proofs, and portable archives.

## Does Winmem control my assets or contracts?

No. Winmem is non-custodial. It does not modify contracts or move funds. It indexes public on-chain data and produces verifiable memory artifacts.

## Can I self-host Winmem?

Yes. Winmem is open-source and designed to be self-hosted via Docker, Kubernetes, or Helm.

## How does Winmem ensure auditability?

Winmem uses canonical hashing and Merkle proofs. Optional on-chain anchoring of Merkle roots provides external tamper-evidence.

## Can I disable AI/LLM features?

Yes. LLM usage is optional. Winmem can operate using deterministic rule-based summaries and raw event data.
